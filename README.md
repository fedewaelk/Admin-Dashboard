# Admin Dashboard - CSS Grid Practice

## Key Features:
- **CSS Grid Layout**: The layout of the dashboard is built entirely with CSS Grid.
- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard adapts to different screen sizes without media queries.
- **Static Navigation**: Links and navigation are present but are not functional in this version, as the focus is primarily on layout practice.

## Project Goals

- Understand and practice creating complex layouts using **CSS Grid**.
- Learn to make layouts responsive using Grid without relying on media queries.
- Create a clean and simple design for an admin dashboard.
- Focus on layout structure, spacing, and grid behavior for different screen sizes.

## Requirements

- Use **CSS Grid** for the layout.
- Design an **Admin Dashboard** interface with sections like sidebar, content area, and header.
- No **media queries** should be used for responsiveness; instead, utilize the gridâ€™s inherent flexibility.
- Links and navigation are placeholders and not functional in this project.
